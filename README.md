# TLC5940 LED Driver Controller

This repository contains a Python script for controlling the TLC5940, a 16-channel LED driver with dot correction and grayscale PWM control. The script is designed for use in microcontroller environments and allows for fine-tuned control of LED brightness and color.

## Overview

The TLC5940 chip is a versatile LED driver that provides 16 individually controlled channels. Each channel has a 4096-step grayscale pulse-width modulation (PWM) control and a 64-step dot correction. This script facilitates the use of these features through a microcontroller's GPIO pins.

## Features

- Control of 16 LED channels
- 4096-step grayscale PWM control per channel
- 64-step dot correction per channel
- Serial interface for data input
- Suitable for microcontroller environments

## Hardware Requirements

- TLC5940 LED Driver Chip
- Microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino with MicroPython)
- LEDs compatible with the TLC5940 specifications
- Necessary connecting wires and resistors

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MicroPython (if using microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi or Arduino)

## Usage

1. Import the `TLC5940_chip` class from the script.
2. Create an instance of the `TLC5940_chip` class with appropriate GPIO pin configurations.
3. Use the provided methods `DotCorrection_setup` and `GrayScale_cycle` to control the LEDs.
